ESP8266 has a single ADC pin available. It may be used to read voltage at ADC pin or to read module supply voltage (VCC). 

!!! note
    When referring to the ADC pin these terms are used interchangeably: ADC (Analog-to-digital Converter), TOUT, Pin6, A0 or Analog0.  

!!! warning
     Check your Wi-Fi module! The ESP8266 A0 pin supports a maximum voltage of 1.0V. Many newer Wi-Fi modules have an on-board voltage divider to support a higher A0 input voltage range (typically in the range between 0 and 3.3 volts). You may need to use an external voltage divider to ensure your input voltage is in the right range.

By default Tasmota uses the ADC pin to read voltage. The signal comes from an analog [peripheral](), or sometimes from the device itself (see [Shelly 2.5](/devices/Shelly-2.5)). 

After wiring a peripheral to GPIO17 (A0) pin you have to configure it in **Configure Module**:

ESP32 has more ADC pin available, of this something specified for analog input (gpio34, gpio35, gpio36, gpio39). It may be used to read voltage at ADC pin or to read module supply voltage (VCC). 
All analog input pins support 3.3V of max supply. 

After wiring a peripheral to specified Analog Input GPIO pin you have to configure it in **Configure Module**:

#|Option|WebUI display|MQTT mesage
-|-|-|-
0|None| none | none
1|Analog | Analog0 _%value%_ | `{"A0":%value%}`
2|Temperature | Temperature _%value%_ °C (°F) | `{"Temperature":%value%},"TempUnit":"C"}`
3|Light | Illuminance _%value%_ lux | `{"Illuminance":%value%}`
4|Button | none | none
5|Buttoni | none | none
6|Range| Range _%value%_ | `{"Range":%value%}`
7|CT Power| Voltage 230 V<br>Current _%value_ A<br>Power _%value_ W<br>Energy Total _%value_ kWh| `{"Energy":_%value_,"Power":_%value_,"Voltage":230,"Current":_%value_}`

The reading will show in web UI's sensor section as "_%option% %value%_" depending on the selected option. Tasmota calculates the values for temperature and light, analog values can be `1` to `1024`.

!!! note
     When using Temperature (2) or light (3) a calibration could be needed. In case of shifted values [`AdcParam`](Commands.md#adcparam) can be used to calibrate the output.

Example: ADC as `Analog (1)`    
![ADC in web UI](_media/Analog0.png)

A message will be published in `tele/%topic%/SENSOR` JSON response as `"ANALOG": ` depending on the selected option.

Example: ADC as `Light (3)`   
```json
18:55:09 MQT: tele/tasmota/SENSOR = {"Time":"2019-10-31T18:55:09","ANALOG":{"Illuminance":8}}
```

!!! warning
     Careful when setting ADC as Button, if there is constant voltage on the pin it might register as a [long press](Buttons-and-Switches#long-press) and reset the device to firmware defaults

### Rule triggers
Use these triggers in rules:    

`on ANALOG#A0div10 do ...` - when the ADC input changes by more than 1% it provides a value between 0 and 100    

`on Tele-ANALOG#A0 do ...` - triggers on tele messages with Analog object
> `MQT: tele/tasmota/SENSOR = {"Time":"2019-01-14T19:36:51","ANALOG":{"A0":1024}}`

Rule example: [using a potentiometer on analog pin](Rules#use-a-potentiometer).

## ADC_VCC
Instead of an input, ADC pin can be used to measure supply voltage of the ESP module (*this reading in not 100% accurate*). To enable ADC_VCC feature you need to [compile your own build](Compile-your-build):

**If you enable ADC_VCC you cannot use the pin as analog input anymore.**

user_config_override.h flag:
```
// -- Internal Analog input -----------------------
#define USE_ADC_VCC                              // Display Vcc in Power status
```

Supply voltage is published in `tele/%topic%/STATE` under `"Vcc":` in mV:
```
11:14:59 MQT: tele/tasmota/STATE = {"Time":"2019-10-31T11:14:59","Uptime":"0T18:36:12","UptimeSec":66972,"Vcc":3.423,"Heap":28,"SleepMode":"Dynamic","Sleep":50,"LoadAvg":19,"MqttCount":6,"POWER":"OFF","Wifi":{"AP":1,"SSId":"Tasmota","BSSId":"00:00:00:00:00:00","Channel":13,"RSSI":100,"LinkCount":1,"Downtime":"0T00:00:06"}}
```
